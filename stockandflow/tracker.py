    """
    Manage the stock counting and flow event generation for a given model.

    It generates flow events by monitoring for changes to the fields_to_track
    list, runs the old and new field values through the states_to_stocks_func
    function to figure out the source and sink stocks. Then it tries to checks
    if any of the flows will make an event for that transition.

    The states_to_stocks_func recieves a list of the field values in the order
    that they are dexclared in fields_to_track. The function must return a
    tuple of stock (it can be a 1-tuple). This allows a single model's state be
    composed of any number of sub-states/stocks. The resulting previous and
    current state tuples are then compared element by element.

    Thanks to carljm for the monitor in django-model-utils on which the
    change tracking is based.
