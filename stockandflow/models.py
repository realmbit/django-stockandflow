class Stock(object):
    """
    An accumulation defined by a queryset.

    In the abstract a stock is a collection that is counted at a specific time
    interval, generating a StockRecord). The state of an object defines it's
    membership in a given stock. As a result, the words state and stock are
    roughly interchangeable.

    In the specific a stock is a subset of records for a given model that meet
    the conditions defined in the queryset.

    For example a User may have an "active" stock and an "inactive" stock
    defined by whether or not each user.is_active == True.

    Facets is a list of either facet objects or tuples of the form (facet,
    field_prefix). The field prefix maps the object of the stock to the object
    that is filtered in the facet. For example, if there is a User with a
    Profile and a facet on the Profile object like "yada"="true" then a User
    stock would use the field_prefix "profile" so that the field lookup in the facet becomes
    "profile__yada"=True.
